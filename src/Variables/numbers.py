# Numbers are created in the same way that strings are created, except they don't need quotes surrounding them

amountOfSpam = 2

# The symbols used for basic maths are:
# + for addition 
# - for subtraction
# * for multiplication
# / for division

# They follow the same rules as maths for Order of Operations

fourteen = 10 + 8 / 2

# This sum is 14, due to the division of 8 / 2 being calculated before 10 + 8

# If you wanted it to be nine, you would need to surround 10 + 8 in brackets
nine = (10 + 8) / 2
